# [21R0CKET]

[21R0CKET] is a project brought to you by [B10K.IO] in co-development with Anoop *SAFU DEV*.

## problem statement

one of the re-occuring problems that project managers + developers working on the bnb chain face is holders killing projects before they have a chance to build anything. [21R0CKET] aims to deliver a solution to this problem.

## solution proposal

[21R0CKET] is an entirely new concept that could change the future of tokenized projects.

the concept is to build vesting into the token itself. [21R0CKET] holders will be vested for a period of time.

the vesting will occur in a linear manner, meaning that tokens will be released after every block minted.

through this concept of vesting token, we are hoping to accomplish two things:

1. spreadout sell pressure

the release of a small amount of tokens on every block means that the sell pressure will be more spread out. holders will be able to individually define how often they will to claim.

2. community promotion

through vesting, holders will be incentivized to promote the project

## dapp

the team will develop a dapp (available at launch) to help holder navigate the token.

### 1.0 

the holder will be able to connect their wallet and see:

- nb of tokens transfered in
- nb of tokens transfered out
- nb of tokens held
- nb of tokens locked
- nb of tokens available

### 1.1

the holder will be able to buy / sell tokens through the dapp interface

## further utility

at this time there is no further utility proposed by the team. we are happy to assess further utilities proposed by holders.

## private sale

the private sale will raise x bnb. the table below describes how the funds will be spent:

| item                  | amount    |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| contract development  | x bnb     |
| dapp development      | x bnb     |  
| contract auditing     | x bnb     |
| launch marketing      | x bnb     |

any leftover bnb will be added to the liquidity.

private sale holders will be airdropped tokens at launch and are subject to the standard vesting schedule.

## tokenomics

### initial allocation

the initial token supply will be allocated in the following manner:

| holder                | % supply  | cliff     | vesting               |
|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|
| private sale          | x%        | 0         | standard              |
| presale               | x%        | 0         | standard              |
| team                  | x%        | 1 month   | 6 months + standard   |
| burn                  | x%        | 1 month   | 6 months + standard   |

### taxes

the following taxes will be applied to the token:

| tax           | buy   | sell  |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| marketing     | 6%    | 8%    |
| buy + burn    | 2%    | 2%    |
| governance    | 2%    | 3%    |
| development   | 2%    | 3%    |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| total         | 12%   | 16%   |

## risks

below is a non-exhaustive list of potential risks + mitigations

| risks | mitigations |
|-------|-------------|
| project death | when the lp unlocks token holders will have the choice of voting to add the residual lp to the [B10K.IO] community governance token and receive the equivalent $ amount |
| rugpull + other | we aim to be transparent and to build a relationship with the community that is why we keep a history of projects on [our website](https://b10k.io). Additionally, we will be co-developing with Anoop *SAFU DEV*. Anoop is the developer behind several multi-million $ projects and will be the contract owner. |
